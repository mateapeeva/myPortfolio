            <h2>Hi, I'm Matea</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Computer Science student with a love for code, math, and music
                (I might just have a song for every moment).
                I’m endlessly curious — always asking why and never settling without understanding the how.
                <br><br>
                Beyond the screen, I’m a traveler shaped by several Erasmus exchanges, and a volunteer and peer educator for mental health awareness.
                I’m passionate about open conversations and real impact.
                <br><br>
                When I’m not deep in code or thought, I’m probably watching a movie or TV show — comedies and psychological thrillers are my favorites.
                Spain holds a special place in my heart, but I'm always chasing the next story, place, or playlist.
                <br><br>
                Welcome to my corner of the internet — feel free to explore and connect!

        <div class="card-header"><b>Shopgram</b></div>
        <p>As CEO & Co-founder of Shopgram, I’m building a platform that helps
            Instagram sellers manage orders, track performance, and grow
            their business with ease. From conducting user interviews and
            validating our ideas to shaping the product vision and pitching at
            events, I’m deeply involved in every step of the journey.
            Our goal is to create simple, powerful tools that address real
            problems and empower
            small sellers to succeed in the digital marketplace.</p>

        <div class="card-header"><b>Social Day</b></div>
        <p>Social Day is a European initiative connecting youth with
            the working world through one-day experiences in responsible companies.
            As a local coordinator in 2023 and 2024, I collaborated with 30+
            companies and secured over 180 student positions. It’s been a rewarding experience that helped me grow as a leader
            and strengthen my organizational and communication skills.</p>

        <div class="card-header"><b>Peer Educator & Mentor</b></div>
        <p>As a peer educator with Youth Can for over a year,
            I led 40+ workshops on mental health and youth development.
            After completing a mentoring seminar,
            I co-mentored a team of seven new peer educators over five months.
            We guided them through training sessions, team-building, and fieldwork.
            It was a meaningful experience that strengthened my leadership, teamwork,
            and communication skills.</p>
